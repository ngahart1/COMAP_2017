Simulation of traffic at toll booth for COMAP MCM competition, 2017.

Below is a crude picture of a simple 1->3 merge. Cars enter the toll area
from the bottom, proceeding to choose a lane and move towards the toll booths.
Toll booth EX is "express," meaning it is designed solely for cars with an
electronic transponder. Cars know this, and will only enter the left-most lane
when entering the toll area if they have a transponder. Due to the significant
time savings of this lane compared to cash lanes, all cars with a transponder
will enter this lane. Toll boths labeled CS are cash lanes. We assume it takes
10 seconds to pay in a cash lane, once out of the queue.

We assume deceleration is linear: a car observes how far it has to go to reach the
end of the lane, then slows down such that it stops 15 feet behind the last car in
line.
-Acceleration of average car: 3.5 m/s = 11.5 ft/s
